ToDoList
========

An iPhone app that implements a basic to-do list. The first 11 commits were done by following the tutorial below:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html

Currently, the app supports multiple lists each with its own set of items. New lists can be added but cannot yet be deleted or reordered. The list title can be edited, and items can be added, removed, reordered, and checked/unchecked as completed. 

Future plans include adding support for deleting and reordering lists (on the Master List) and upgrading the UI to make it prettier.
