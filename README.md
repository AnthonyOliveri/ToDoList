ToDoList
========

An iPhone app that implements a basic to-do list. The first 11 commits were done by following the tutorial below:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html

Currently, the app supports a single list. The list title can be edited, and items can be added, removed, reordered, and checked/unchecked as completed. 

Future plans include adding support for multiple lists and upgrading the UI to make it prettier.
